<p align="left">I am a student specializing in Frontend Development. I am currently studying at the University of Information Technology,  Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City.

In my studies, I have acquired knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are fundamental technologies for Frontend development. I have also delved into popular library such as React to build high-quality and maintainable web applications. I've also worked with Node.js to create server-side applications and interact with databases like MongoDB.

I am passionate about creating appealing and interactive user interfaces that provide a seamless user experience across different devices. I stay updated with the latest trends in the Frontend field to enhance my skills and apply advanced development techniques.</p>
